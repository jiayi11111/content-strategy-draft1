    <p class="detail"> When I was in kindergarten, almost all my friend's parents encouraged their children to learn a musical instrument- the musical instruments like piano and violin occupied the most. According to statistics, In 2008, there were more than 30 million people learning piano, more than 10 million people learning violin, and the number will increase 10 percent every year. The development of living, children may have more chances to get in touch or explore a musical instrument, but musical instruments are just limited to we are similar like cello, or erhu, and so on? In fact, Musical instruments are commonly referred to as musical instruments in many non-musical fields, such as the bowl in our daily life that can be made to make a sound using our hands or chopsticks.</p>

    <div class="detail2" id="detail2">Considering the prevalence of people learning musical instruments,  I have a plan to bring a special experience combined with music and technology in interacting between humans and machines.  The project “ performer– remix Canon” is based on an interactive part, and also provides users a visual experience with a sense of line and vividness. The project in order to define playing musical instruments is not limited to traditional instruments (physical instruments) but combined with technology, making musical instruments more diversified and personalized. So, In “performer– Canon remix”, when the experiencer's hand pose triggers the corresponding button, the project will play a random canon clip played by different instruments combined with background music to create a unique canon performance. In the project, the experience can play the melody of different instruments through the "machine" which is a musical instrument that makes sound. Not only that, the experience can also interact with the background and volume through nose movement and eye distance from the screen.</div>
